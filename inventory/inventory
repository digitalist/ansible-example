# every non-executable file you place here
# will be treated as a static inventory file by ansible
# according to ../ansible.cfg
#
# ! do not place passwords here !
#
# if you feel the urge to place a password here
# do something like
#
# ln -s ~/.secure/aws-static-inventory inventory
# 
#
# because IT IS A VERY BAD IDEA TO STORE PASSWORDS
# IN A CODE OR INFRASTRUCTURE REPO
